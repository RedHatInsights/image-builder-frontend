# Testing information

## Code coverage

Code coverage is recorded in
[codecov.io](https://codecov.io/gh/osbuild/image-builder-frontend/).
This information comes only from unit tests and for the time being
we're not concerned with collecting coverage information from integration
tests.

It must be **over 85%** as required by Insights QE!
